#  DLND TV Script Generation

### The third project for the [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)


In this project we built a network to generate our own Simpsons TV scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

The project was implemented in Python and using Numby and Tensorflow.

#### Topics covered are:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- LSTM
- Word Embedding
